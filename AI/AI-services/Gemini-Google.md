Is Gemini different than Bard or just better version of Bard?

Bard is a chatbot based on LLMs developed by Google. .... Bard was at first based on an LLM named LaMDA and since a few months ago replaced by PaLM 2.
Gemini is also an LLM by Google. We don't know yet for sure, but Google will probably replace PaLM 2 with Gemini and keep the name Bard for its chatbot
