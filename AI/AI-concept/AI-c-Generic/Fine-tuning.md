## Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning in machine learning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model for specific tasks or use cases. https://www.ibm.com/topics/fine-tuning


>  Fine-tuning is where you take an already-pre-trained model and further train it on a more specific dataset. This dataset is typically smaller and focused on a particular domain or task. The purpose of fine-tuning is to adapt the model to perform better in specific scenarios or on tasks that were not well covered during pre-training. The new knowledge added during fine-tuning is more about enhancing the model's performance in specific contexts rather than broadly expanding its general knowledge.
