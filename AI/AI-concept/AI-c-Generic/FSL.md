Few-shot learning (FSL) - ... an AI model learns to make accurate predictions by training on a very small number of labeled examples. https://www.ibm.com/topics/few-shot-learning

N-shot learning is when an machine learning model can learn a new task by seeing N examples of that task. So 1-shot means the model only needs a 1 labeled example to learn a new task, few-shot model needs more, say 5-20





#### One-shot learning (in computer vision)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_learning_(computer_vision)  ....object categorization algorithms require training on hundreds or thousands of examples, one-shot learning aims to classify objects from one, or only a few, examples.
