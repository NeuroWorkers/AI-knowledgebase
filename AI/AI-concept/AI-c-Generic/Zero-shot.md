Slightly incorrect, perhaps. Zero-shot refers to identifying a new category of data that a model is not trained on -- i.e. I tell a toddler who has never seen a snake what a snake looks like, and they spot a snake. The toddler does this by using other learned data features (skin, scale, texture, size, shape, animal type) and extrapolating to the snake in the grass. Its not that the model is given "no context" when trained, its just that the novel identification emerges from the properties of the model. This is very much how we work!
