### Deep learning
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning
> **Deep learning** is part of a broader family of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") methods, which is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network "Artificial neural network") with [representation learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_learning "Representation learning"). Learning can be [supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning "Supervised learning"), [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning "Semi-supervised learning") or [unsupervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning "Unsupervised learning").[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#cite_note-NatureBengio-2)



### ML - Machine learning
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning
**Machine learning** (**ML**) is a field devoted to understanding and building methods that let machines "learn" – that is, methods that leverage data to improve computer performance on some set of tasks.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-1)

Machine learning [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") build a model based on sample data, known as [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data "Training data"), in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-2) Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, [email filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering "Email filtering"), [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition"), [agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture"), and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-tvt-3)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-4)

### text-to-image model 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model
A **text-to-image** model is a [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning "Machine learning") model which takes an input [natural language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") description and produces an image matching that description. Such models began to be developed in the mid-2010s, as a result of advances in [deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning "Deep learning"). In 2022, the output of state of the art text-to-image models, such as OpenAI's [DALL-E 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E_2 "DALL-E 2"), Google Brain's [Imagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagen_(Google_Brain) "Imagen (Google Brain)") and StabilityAI's [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion "Stable Diffusion") began to approach the quality of real photographs and human-drawn art.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models
A foundation model (also called base model)[1] is a large machine learning (ML) model trained on a vast quantity of data at scale (often by self-supervised learning or semi-supervised learning)[2] resulting in a model that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.[3][4] Foundation models have helped bring about a major transformation in how AI systems are built, such as by powering prominent chatbots and other user-facing AI. The Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence's (HAI) Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM) popularized the term.[3]

### LLM - large language model (LLM)

https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/large-language-model-LLM 

A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate and predict new content. The term generative AI also is closely connected with LLMs, which are, in fact, a type of generative AI that has been specifically architected to help generate text-based content.
