>  ... They've open-sourced bitnet.cpp: a blazing-fast 1-bit LLM inference framework that runs directly on CPUs. You can now run 100B parameter models on local devices with up to 6x speed improvements and 82% less energy consumption—all without a GPU!

bitnet.cpp is the official inference framework for 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58). It offers a suite of optimized kernels, that support fast and lossless inference of 1.58-bit models on CPU (with NPU and GPU support coming next).
