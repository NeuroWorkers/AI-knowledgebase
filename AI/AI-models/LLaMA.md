LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a large language model (LLM) released by Meta AI in February 2023. A variety of model sizes were trained ranging from 7 billion to 65 billion parameters. LLaMA's developers reported that the 13 billion parameter model's performance on most NLP benchmarks exceeded that of the much larger GPT-3 (with 175 billion parameters) and that the largest model was competitive with state of the art models such as PaLM and Chinchilla.[1] Whereas the most powerful LLMs have generally been accessible only through limited APIs (if at all), Meta released LLaMA's model weights to the research community under a noncommercial license.[2] Within a week of LLaMA's release, its weights were leaked to the public on 4chan via BitTorrent.[3]

 > 5% of the Llama 3 pretraining dataset consists of high-quality non-English data that covers over 30 languages. However, we do not expect the same level of performance in these languages as in English.
