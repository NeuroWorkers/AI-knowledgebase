.... do you remember this paper less than twoweeks old. it made Waves by concluding
that open source models can mimic the style but not the factuality of chat GPT ....

The first model set to be opensourced that actually comes close to ChatGPT, and is just 13B (that's small enough for a laptop). The 51 page report from Microsoft was released just 48 hours ago but I have gone through it all, and bring relevant insights from 5 other papers.

By imitating the logic and explanations of GPT 4 (and using GPT 3.5 as an assistant), as well as by training on diverse tasks and an order of magnitude more examples, we have Orca. I will showcase it on a dozen benchmarks and go through in detail how it works and why. 

I will also end on comments from Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever on whether Opensource will catch-up...
